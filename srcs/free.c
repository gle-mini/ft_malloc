 * ft_free:
 *   Frees the memory block pointed to by ptr. The function:
 *   - Returns immediately if ptr is NULL.
 *   - Retrieves the block header (which is located immediately before the user pointer).
 *   - Marks the block as free.
 *   - Coalesces adjacent free blocks to reduce fragmentation.
 *   - For TINY and SMALL zones, if all blocks in the zone are free, the entire zone is unmapped.
 *   - For LARGE allocations (which are mmapâ€™d individually), the zone is unmapped immediately.
